## 1.0.1 - 1 May 2017 - First Patch!
This patch, although small, will hopefully improve the use of the package settings! It's been awhile since the release of this package, so I thought it would be a good time to release a patch :smile:
###### Bug Fixes
* Changes to the nighttime and daytime themes in package settings now update the editor themes accordingly (See PR [#5](https://github.com/robbawebba/night-light/pull/5))

###### Miscellaneous
* Update `README.md`
* Update `package.json` with new keywords

## 1.0.0 - 6 April 2017 - First public release!
