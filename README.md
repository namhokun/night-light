Night-Light automatically updates your Atom themes with each sunrise and sunset to help reduce eyestrain while you're working hard!

### Features
* **Automatic or manual location updating**: Let Night-Light automatically determine your location for you, or provide a custom latitude and longitude to determine sunrise and sunset times.
* **Automatic or custom scheduling**: Let Night-Light automatically switch themes for you at sunrise and sunset each day, or provide your own times to switch themes.
* **Customizable UI and syntax themes for day and night**: Customize your daytime and nighttime appearances based on your installed UI and syntax themes.
* **Manually switch modes at your leisure**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + m` to manually toggle between nighttime and daytime themes at your leisure, or customize your own keybindings in your keymap.
